SMPC
====
This project is a simulation platform for computing complexity of various secure multi-party computation algorithms. There are some simulations for certain events that happen and general models that are defined. 

Note: The accuracy of this simulations are not high. If you need a very high accuracy, you need to change the code and implement your own models of the events.
